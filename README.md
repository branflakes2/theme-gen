This is a tool that I plan to automatically pick and set color schemes for 
.Xresources, i3-gaps, and i3bar. If I end up posting it somewhere, I hope other
people will add support for other applications.

Planned features:
color scheme based on picture
random color scheme 
save favorite color schemes and restore them

Master plan: have a folder full of my favorite wallpapers, and have one be
randomly chosen at random. Then have this application generate a color scheme
for each wallpaper and set them at login. 

I plan to use external tools for the actual generation of the color schemes
